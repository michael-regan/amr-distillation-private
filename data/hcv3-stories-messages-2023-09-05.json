We got to the zoo early before many of the large groups came and grabbed a snack from the snack bar so we could get a head start on seeing our favorite animals. Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions. The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that! It felt like a much needed day together with my girlfriend. It meant a lot to me personally, as I have been stressed at work and Ashley finds a way to get me talk about some of the things I've been holding in. It was truly a wonderful experience.

He started walking around 12 months old, the typical age. However, shoes were hard to find to accommodate his much wider than average foot. We spoke with a specialist when he was two years old, but she wanted to wait at least a year for the surgery because the risks from anesthesia lessen in slightly older children. We returned to the specialist just after he turned four. Given that the surgery wasn't an emergency, we had to wait a few months for an appointment time to be available. On the day of the surgery my son was calm and happy. Being so young, he wasn't really aware what was about to happen. The surgery was also taking place in a children's hospital, so they had a lot of toys and other accommodations to make him feel comfortable. The surgery went quickly and smoothly, but waking up was difficult for my son. He was in a lot of pain and required three shots of morphine into his IV before he felt better. However, after that initial discomfort, the rest of the recovery went really well. He never needed pain medicine and was up waking around with his cast by that evening. After two weeks, he was able to have his cast removed. His foot was tender and sensitive without the support and protection of the cast, but after about three days he was able to walk normally again.

We returned to the specialist just after he turned four. Given that the surgery wasn't an emergency, we had to wait a few months for an appointment time to be available. On the day of the surgery my son was calm and happy. Being so young, he wasn't really aware what was about to happen. The surgery was also taking place in a children's hospital, so they had a lot of toys and other accommodations to make him feel comfortable. The surgery went quickly and smoothly, but waking up was difficult for my son. He was in a lot of pain and required three shots of morphine into his IV before he felt better. However, after that initial discomfort, the rest of the recovery went really well. He never needed pain medicine and was up waking around with his cast by that evening. After two weeks, he was able to have his cast removed. His foot was tender and sensitive without the support and protection of the cast, but after about three days he was able to walk normally again. Now the only thing that remains from the surgery is a light scar on the side of his foot.\nAnonymized story\n"}], [{"role": "system", "content": "Anonymize the story."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A memorable event that I have recently had happen was when my four year old son had foot surgery this past Thursday.

As a baby it was easier to manage, since babies obviously don't need shoes, but now as a preschooler his extra little toe would often hurt him while wearing tennis shoes. My husband and I always knew that he would need this surgery, but we were still worried when the day actually arrived. Neither he nor I, nor our older son, had ever needed surgery before. This was uncharted waters for us. When we arrived at the hospital Thursday morning, the nurses took his vitals to make sure he was healthy enough for surgery that day. Other than that, a lot of the time was just spent waiting. It made my husband and I feel sad because our son was hungry but he was not allowed to eat prior to the surgery. Thankfully the hospital did have a good amount of toys that helped keep him distracted. Finally around 12:30 in the afternoon he was taken back for his surgery. My husband and I were not allowed to go back with him, but the nurses and doctors made it fun for him by taking him back in a big push car. Once they got to the room, they put a small mask on his face with the strawberry scented gas he had picked out earlier. After he was asleep with the gas, they put the needle in his hand for the other anesthesia. Surgery only lasted about one hour. The nurse came to get my husband and I to take us to where our son was recovering. He's normally a really happy little guy, but unfortunately he was in a lot of pain and very confused coming out of his surgery. He ended up needing three shots of morphine in his IV to manage the discomfort. Thankfully it seemed to work quickly and soon we were on our way home. He seems to be recovering well and we're thankful his surgery was an over-all uneventful, yet memorable, experience.\nAnonymized story\n"}], [{"role": "system", "content": "Anonymize the story using k-anonymity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "A memorable event that I have recently had happen was when my four year old son had foot surgery this past Thursday.

I was shopping in a grocery store and there was quite a few people there that day. When I was shopping, I went to grab a griddle, but as I grabbed it there was a woman right behind me who started questioning me and cussing me out for taking the last available griddle. I had to defend my purchase, so I just ignored her and kept shopping. Later on, I left my cart alone and noticed that the woman took my griddle out of my shopping cart, which pretty infuriating. I secretly \"stole\" it back into my cart without her noticing and watched her checkout without realizing it was gone. I felt bad but at the same time I found the griddle first. I wish that I could have seen her realize that she didn't have the griddle in the parking lot but I didn't get the chance to see this woman again.

We went down to the Keys to celebrate a long year of hard work and take some time off together and finally get some quality time. We went down under the water the first day, after a few alcoholic beverages (of course). The fish were awesome, the life was so colorful, but no color more intense than the sunburn I had when we finished up! Oh boy, did I make a mistake forgetting to put on sunscreen that day. I came out like an infrared camera on a hot cherry cobbler -- I am talking molten red. I remember saying, \"well, I'm gonna pay for this hard later on tonight!\" By the night time, I decided that if I drank more iced beverages it might keep my mind off of the sunburn, and, surprisingly, that worked well for a while. Sleeping was hell on Earth, though, as I had to lay on ice packs borrowed from the resort desk to even close my eyes. Luckily, the burns subsided rather quickly, and simply glowed an awful red for a few days before turning into a nice tan. Thankfully for me, I've always had a good ability to recover quickly from sunburns. Perhaps that's why I always forget about sunscreen? Hmm, I don't know, but it wasn't fun. After that fiasco, we got to do much more of what we had planned, enjoying snorkeling and swimming and honestly just a lot of relaxing. It was really great even if I did get destroyed by the Sun.\nAnonymized story\n"}], [{"role": "system", "content": "Anonymize the story."}, {"role": "user", "content": "My most memorable event that occurred to me happened in April of this year. It was when my boyfriend and I drove to Florida and went to the Florida Keys. We went snorkeling and this was the first time both of us had ever done this. It was memorable because of how amazing the experience was being somewhere completely new doing an activity and viewing things in a new way that we hadn't experienced before. And we got to do it together. It barely cost us any money and we got to have a great experience. The most surprising part of the whole ordeal was that I wasn't scared to go out deep into the ocean. I felt healthy and good about myself and the fact that I accomplished something that for myself was a big feat even if other people might not see it as a big deal. I had been very nervous to do this. We viewed sea creatures such as a few fish, a giant crab, and other smaller little crabs. There wasn't very many fish which I was surprised about but the experience was still interesting. I saw the way the sea worked and all of its components that make it the ecosystem it is today. I also realized how hot the sun is down there because we both got very burnt on our backs from them being exposed to the sun for a few hours. The time went by faster than I can ever remember and it was my most memorable experience this year. We want to go back but have no idea when. I believe next time we would like to do a type of tour instead of just swimming aimlessly about and we hope to do it again soon.\nAnonymized story\n"}], [{"role": "system", "content": "Anonymize the story using k-anonymity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "My most memorable event that occurred to me happened in April of this year.

Some of the other things that I remember is playing darts with people I never met before, we had fun and I felt connected just playing this simple game. I also remember meeting a cute girl, she a blond hair and her name was Anabel, I felt like I known her for ages for some reason, maybe it was the music that made me feel nostalgic but probably it was just a dejavu. The birthdays itself lasted for two days, since it stated on the weekend and my friend could afford an even longer holiday. There were a lot of fun thing to do and the food was amazing, my favorite dish was pizza of course, it was a real Italian pizza from some high end catering service. Also the fresh sashimi was great and tasty. The music was great and the DJ did a great job adjusting to our mood and taking guest requests into consideration. So this birthday was more of a concert than a typical home birthday I am used to and expected to experience.  There were some people whom I've know since I was a kid and it was a very pleasant meeting since we haven't seen each other for ages.  At midnight there was a fireworks show and not like a small fireworks that you can buy anywhere on Halloween but an actual commercial grade fireworks which were huge and loud like it was a major holiday or something, so I really enjoyed that part since you don't see that too often in a common weekend. Since it was a two day celebration and since my friend has a big house, most guests could just stay overnight in one of the bedrooms, it made us all feel even closer and the next morning I felt even more connected to the new people I have met the previous day as well as to my old childhood friends.  Overall it was one of the best birthday celebrations in my life and I really enjoyed it and will probably remember it for a long time if not till the rest of my life.
