Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions. The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that! It felt like a much needed day together with my girlfriend.

He started walking around 12 months old, the typical age. However, shoes were hard to find to accommodate his much wider than average foot. We spoke with a specialist when he was two years old, but she wanted to wait at least a year for the surgery because the risks from anesthesia lessen in slightly older children.

On the day of the surgery my son was calm and happy. Being so young, he wasn't really aware what was about to happen. The surgery was also taking place in a children's hospital, so they had a lot of toys and other accommodations to make him feel comfortable. The surgery went quickly and smoothly, but waking up was difficult for my son. He was in a lot of pain and required three shots of morphine into his IV before he felt better. However, after that initial discomfort, the rest of the recovery went really well. He never needed pain medicine and was up waking around with his cast by that evening. After two weeks, he was able to have his cast removed. His foot was tender and sensitive without the support and protection of the cast, but after about three days he was able to walk normally again.

I didn't even prepare a backup plan in case I was having a bad time and needed to leave abruptly. I was fully committed to having fun at the party. Well as it turns out, I had a great time. I instantly made some new friends to keep close to for a majority of the party and we played a lot of games to help integrate everyone together and get everyone included. Everyone I met was nice and friendly and everyone made everyone feel welcome. I had a great time and wound up staying at the party from right when it started right up until it ended. This was a pretty big deal for me because I am very shy. I am especially shy around new people. However, I was able to break out of my shell and enjoy myself. I'm happy I did. I had a lot of fun and made some new friends that I will be in contact with more going forward. I cannot wait for the next get together with all of these people.\nAnonymized story\n"}]]
