Here we test the effects of climate, topographic variation and pre-fire stand structure on regeneration in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests following high-severity fire over the past seven decades.\n\nWe surveyed lodgepole pine regeneration 8\u201367 years after eight high-severity fires in western Colorado and southern Wyoming. We used dendroecological methods and machine learning to (a) identify temporal trends in post-fire regeneration and (b) examine influences of climate on post-fire regeneration, with focus on post-fire establishment, initial post-fire density and radial growth.\n\nAll burned sites reached a median stocking density of \u2265150 seedlings/ ha, but there was a large range of spatial heterogeneity, with regeneration being absent or scarce in many plots, implying a trend of increasing patchiness with likely cascading effects on subsequent patterns and processes. Our analysis indicated that (a) post-fire regeneration is influenced by pre-fire stand structure (stand age and density), elevation and post-fire minimum temperature; (b) pre-fire densities of >14,000 stems/ha promoted successful stocking (\u2265150 seedlings/ha) and reduced lag between the disturbance and initial regeneration; and (c) minimum post-fire temperatures >\u22121.6\u00b0C reduced lag of initial regeneration and promoted initial radial growth.\n\nSynthesis. Our study demonstrates that lodgepole pine in high-elevation forests are regenerating following fires under recent climatic trends, but that regeneration is affected by post-fire climatic conditions.
